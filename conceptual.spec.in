Summary: coNCePTuaL: A Network Correctness and Performance Testing Language
Version: @VERSION@
Release: 1
Source0: %{name}-%{version}.tar.gz
Vendor: Los Alamos National Laboratory

%description
coNCePTuaL is a domain-specific programming language for rapidly
generating programs that measure the performance and/or test the
correctness of networks and network protocol layers.  A few lines of
coNCePTuaL code can produce programs that would take significantly
more effort to write in a conventional programming language.
